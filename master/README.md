# Required Software
* VirtualBOX: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads


# Install
## Setup Host System
1. Install Vagrant on your host machine
    * For how-to instructions on installing Vagrant: https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/
2. Install VirtualBox on your host machine


## Setup VM with Vagrant
1. Open up a terminal/console window and go to the directory where the 'Vagrantfile' lives

		cd /path/to/vanilla_ckan/ckan-vagrant

2. Before running vagrant, we'll need the virtualbox guest plugin in-order for vb's shared folders to work with the vm

		vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

3. Run Vagrant

		vagrant up

4. For shell access, you can use vagrant's ssh command

		vagrant ssh

    Note*: to use this command, you must be in the same directory as the 'Vagrantfile'

Optional: If you wish to use ssh natively or want to use scp, copy the output from ssh-config to your ssh config file

        vagrant ssh-config >> ~/.ssh/config

    Note*: you will also need to be in the same directory as the 'Vagrantfile' when you run this command


## Setup the Dev Environment
1. Open the ckan-init.sh script in your favourite text editor
	* We'll be copying the commands listed in the script
    * Review output as steps are executed
    * Please read the comments in the script, because they include some important bits that you'll need to follow
2. If you've installed the bcgov vagrant before, please review the differences section at the bottom of this document.


Note: ckan-init.sh *can* be executed as a script now, but might have some issues, use at your own discretion 
        
        cd /apps/ckan/conf
        sh ckan-init.sh


## Creating a Sysadmin account

        paster --plugin=ckan sysadmin add <username> -c /apps/ckan/conf/development.ini


# Startup
1. Run these commands to start ckan after startup:

		. /usr/lib/ckan/ckan_env/bin/activate

		pg_ctl -D /usr/lib/ckan/data -l /apps/logs/db/db.log start

		/apps/solr/bin/solr start

		datapusher /apps/ckan/conf/datapusher_settings.py &

		paster --plugin=ckan serve /apps/ckan/conf/development.ini &


# Stopping Ckan and Co.
## To stop ckan and datapusher
1. View the processes for ckan and datapusher

        ps aux | grep python

2. Find the process id for ckan (or datapusher) and kill the process

        kill -15 <id>

3. If you're not sure if ckan or datapusher stopped, re-run step 1
    * if you don't see the process you're good
    * if you still see it, try force killing the process

            kill -9 <id>

## To stop solr
        
        /apps/solr/bin/solr stop -p 8983

## To stop the db
        
        pg_ctl -D /usr/lib/ckan/data stop


# Making contributions to ckan and extensions
TODO


# Run Ckan Tests
1. Go into the ckan source directory
        
        cd ~/ckan/src/ckan

2. Run this command to begin testing, this will take awhile...
        
        nosetests --ckan --reset-db --with-pylons=/apps/ckan/conf/test-core.ini --nologcapture --with-coverage --cover-package=ckan --cover-package=ckanext ckan ckanext


# Troubleshooting
## Debug Mode
- TODO: use ckan instructions and use the less compiler
- AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'css/main.debug.css'
    - fix:
            cp /usr/lib/ckan/ckan_env/src/ckan/ckan/public/base/css/main.css /usr/lib/ckan/ckan_env/src/ckan/ckan/public/base/css/main.debug.css
